# Support Contacts

## Users within the HPC Midlands+ Consortium

Users within the HPC Midlands+ consortium (including those who have gained access via the EPSRC Access to HPC Calls) should contact their local research computing teams. A list of these support contacts at each institution is shown below.

University | Support Contact / E-mail / Web site
---------- | -----------------------------------
Aston University | [Support Email](mailto:hpc_support@aston.ac.uk)
University of Birmingham | [IT Service Desk](http://www.itservicedesk.bham.ac.uk/)

If they are unable to answer or resolve your query, your local support team will escalate the issue to the team at the University of Warwick who are managing Sulis.

## UKRI Access to HPC users

Support is provided via the [Sulis HPC GitHub organisation](https://github.com/sulis-hpc/support-access). You will be
invited to join this organisation when your project is allocated resource on Sulis.

# Research Software Engineering support

Users within the HPC Midlands+ consortium are able to request support from a Research Software Engineer (RSE) when applying for access to Sulis through their institution. Research Software Engineers are skilled individuals with experience to help with the following non-exhaustive list:

* Profiling of code to understand performance and recommend areas of improvement
* Developing code to add new functionality, improve scaling, add parallelism, or improve software maintainability
* Optimise code for performance on Sulis
* Wring the best performance out of code with complier flag choices
* Advise on matters of best practise regarding development of workflows and version control.

Please request RSE support at the time of your application, or afterwards via your Support Contact.
